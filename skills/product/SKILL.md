description: Use when a feature starts (a new capability, or a change of what the product does for its users), when a bug fix changes business logic, when a branch or pull request is reviewed (someone else's, or one's own with no worth check at its start), when brainstorming asks a question that chooses between ways, when a decision concerns the whole project (the licence, open source or not, distribution, pricing, the money model, the hosting), when a task may be deferred or closed for its worth, or when PRODUCT.md or a PDR is written or checked.

# Product

A task is worth its cost, or it is not. This skill asks that before the work,
from outside the code: who gains and how many, the money, the direction of
the project, the law, the client, and what fails when a part fails. Another
way, a deferral or a close is a good answer. The person decides.
`kalinichenko:architecture` decides how the code does it; this skill decides
whether to build it, and what.

| Moment | Depth | Read first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A feature starts: a new capability, or a change of what the product does for its users | full | *The run* |
| A bug fix that changes business logic: a rule, a calculation, a state, a permission, the data | light | *The run* |
| A review of someone else's branch or pull request | full, always | *The trace* |
| A review of one's own branch | none when a report for it exists; else as a feature | *The trace* |
| A question in brainstorming that chooses between ways | light; full for a decision about the whole project | *In brainstorming* |
| A decision about the whole project: the licence, open source or not, distribution, pricing, the money model, the hosting | full | *The run* |
| A project with no store, or the person asks for one | the offer | `store.md` |

A bug fix that changes no business logic gets no run. `reader.md` and
`store.md` sit next to this file, in this skill's base directory `<dir>`.
Read `reader.md` before the first run: it holds the criteria, the checks and
the shape of the report, for the readers of the panel and for the light
depth. Read `store.md` before the first read or write of the store.

**Light.** The main session alone, with no web search. It reads the index of
`PRODUCT.md` and the PDRs that the task touches. The report has the verdict
and its reason, and another field only when it has content.

**Full.** The panel (*The panel*): two readers in parallel, each with a web
search, and neither sees the other's answer. The main session merges them.

## The trace

The person's own branch gets no second report: a report exists when the spec
of the work, the pull request's description, the issue, or a PDR that the
branch adds holds a `**Verdict:**` line. The test is the trace, not the
author: the person's branch with no report at its start gets one at the
review.

Someone else's work gets the full depth always, with a report or without
one, and their spec and description are the decisions to check. Someone
else's work is a pull request whose author is not the account that `gh` is
logged in as, or, with no pull request, a branch whose commits have another
author's email than `git config user.email`.

A report at a review goes into the pull request's description, so that the
next review finds it.

## In brainstorming

The skill runs only at a fork: a question that chooses between ways, as
"fetch it on each request, or download it once". Never at a question that
asks the person to describe. `superpowers:brainstorming` keeps its order: its
first message is the opt-out line and one question, so the report never
comes before that question.

At a fork, the report comes in the message that asks the question, before
its options, and its options become the options of the question. It may show
that the conversation went the wrong way: say so plainly, with the proof.
The answer stays the person's.

## The run

1. **Find the store** (`store.md`). With none, make the offer of `store.md`
   once a session, and go on without a store. At the full depth, send the
   panel now (*The panel*), and wait for both readers before step 7.
2. **Understand the task:** who has the problem, how many of them by real
   data, and how others solve it. At the full depth, with a web search.
3. **Collect the three sides:** the client (what they ask, and the goal
   behind it), the law (the rules that apply, with the primary source), and
   the project (its direction in `PRODUCT.md`, its milestone, the decisions
   that the task touches).
4. **Show the conflicts** between the three sides. Do not smooth them.
5. **The criteria and the checks** of `reader.md`.
6. **Each accepted decision that the task touches** (*Accepted decisions*).
7. **The report** (`reader.md`), then the person's decision (*The person
   decides*), then the store.

The report goes in a message before the work that it judges: with a spec, at
the spec's start, after the block of *The start of a feature*; at a review,
before round 1 and in the pull request's description.

## Accepted decisions

An accepted decision is a hypothesis that won once. When the task touches
one, check three things:

- Does its *Rests on* still hold? At the full depth, search for a change: a
  new law, a new price, a new limit.
- Did its *Revisit when* condition come?
- Did it get in the way: does the task have to go around it? Then a line goes
  into its *Got in the way* after the person decides. With two lines there,
  propose to revisit it.

The report names the decision in **Touches decisions:**, with what changed.
Only the person changes its status.

## The person decides

The skill never refuses or cancels the work. A verdict other than `do it` is
a question to the person, and the work that it judges waits for the answer.

With no person, as in a run that a script starts or with "do not ask
questions", the work goes on as it was asked. Then the last message of the
turn starts with the report, its `**Verdict:**` line first, and its
questions marked `open`. The pull request's description holds the same
report.

After the answer:

- The decision goes into the store, by `store.md`: a new PDR, or a line in
  *Got in the way* or *Checked* of an existing one.
- `defer until <condition>`: after a yes, the issue goes to Later with
  `plan.sh later` of `kalinichenko:roadmap`, and the condition goes into the
  issue's text.
- `close`: after a yes, the issue closes as not planned through
  `kalinichenko:github`, with the report in its comment.

## The panel

Send both readers in one message, in the background:

- **Fable:** an `Agent` call with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and
  `model: "fable"`.
- **Codex,** from the root of the repository:

  ```bash
  codex --search exec -s read-only --ephemeral - <<'EOF'
  <the prompt>
  You are one reviewer that another agent runs: start no skill, change no file, and file nothing.
  EOF
  ```

  `--search` goes before `exec`.

The prompt of each is the text of `<dir>/reader.md`, then the brief:

- the task: the issue, the spec or the pull request, with its text;
- `PRODUCT.md`, or "no store";
- the PDRs that the task touches;
- the **Touches:** line of the block of *The start of a feature*, when there
  is one;
- for someone else's work, their spec and description, as the decisions to
  check.

Not the conversation: a reader that sees it argues from it.

**The merge**, in the main session. Join the points that say the same thing,
and drop none. A point that goes against what the conversation agreed goes
to the person as it is: the main session sees the task through the
conversation, and this rule guards against that. Where the readers disagree,
the **Readers disagree:** line says so, with each reader's side.

**Fallbacks.** With no `codex` command, when `codex login status` fails, or
when the run fails: Fable alone, and the report says so. When Codex returns
no source URL, it had no search: the report says that its points rest on no
web search.

**Cost.** The full depth costs two readers with a web search. That is why it
runs only at the moments of the table that say "full".

## Models

| Step | Who |
| --- | --- |
| The light depth | the main session |
| The readers of the full depth | Fable, `model: "fable"`, and Codex |
| The merge, the report and the store | the main session |

Codex as the host has no subagent with a model and does not call itself:
the main session does the full depth alone, with its own web search, and the
report says so.

## Other skills

- `kalinichenko:architecture` sends here at the start of a feature. Its block
  keeps **Problem:** and **Touches:**; this skill's report answers whether
  the problem needs solving and the simplest way. When a PDR changes, the
  ADRs that name it go to the architect (`store.md`).
- `kalinichenko:review-loop` sends here before round 1 (*Worth first*), and
  at a finding that shows that the capability gives nothing.
- `kalinichenko:github` closes an issue, and `kalinichenko:roadmap` puts one
  off to Later.

## Red flags

| Thought | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "The person asked for it, so it is worth doing" | A request names a solution. Count who gains first, from the real data. |
| "The benefit is small, but the task is clear, so I build it" | A small benefit is the finding. Give the count and the cheaper way, and ask. |
| "The architect checked the task" | The architect checks where the code goes, not whether to build it. |
| "I can check it myself; the panel is too much here" | The table sets the depth. A feature start is full: send both readers, and wait for them. |
| "I will widen a limit to make it work: a CSP, a quota, a permission" | A limit that blocks the feature is a decision of the product. It goes in the report, and the person decides. |
| "A general risk is better than none" | A risk with no number and no source for this task is noise. Leave it out. |
| "The decision is accepted, so it is settled" | An accepted decision is a hypothesis that won once. Check its *Rests on*. |
| "The verdict is close, so I stop the task" | The person decides. Ask, and wait for the answer. |
| "No one can answer, so the report can wait" | The last message of the turn starts with the report, and the pull request's description holds it. |
