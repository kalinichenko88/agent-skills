# TypeScript conventions

A codebase that consistently does otherwise wins — match it and say so.

## Object shapes are `type`, never `interface`

```ts
type User = { id: string; name: string };    // yes
interface User { id: string; name: string }  // no
```

Extension is intersection: `type Admin = User & { role: Role }`.

`interface` is correct for exactly two things — declaration merging and module
augmentation (`declare module 'x' { interface Y { … } }`). Each one carries a
comment naming which; without it it reads as a slip.

Biome: `lint/style/useConsistentTypeDefinitions` at `error`, `style: "type"`.
ESLint: `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions` set to `"type"`.
Biome does not see `interface X extends Y` — close that bypass with an AST check
only where the guarantee matters.

## `strict: true`, and no `any`

Reach for `unknown` plus a narrowing guard, or a generic. An `any` that survives
review is a type hole, not a shortcut.

## Bodies are braced and expanded

No implicit arrow returns in callbacks and handlers, no one-line braced `if`.
The body goes on its own line, even when it is one statement.

## Render conditions are named constants

```tsx
const settings = config.data?.settings;
const needsInvoiceSetup = settings !== undefined && !isConfigured(settings);

if (needsInvoiceSetup) {
  return <List>…</List>;
}
```

The condition is declared above the return with the other consts, and the name
says what the branch means, not how it is computed. Inline,
`config.data && !isConfigured(config.data.settings)` makes the reader evaluate
the expression to find out what the screen is about.

Narrowing survives the alias only for a `const` holding a whole value. A `let`
drops it, and so does a condition written against `config.data` — bind the value
first, as above, or the branch loses the `undefined` check it just made.

## A branch becomes a component when it has handlers and depth

Both, not either: callbacks of its own — `onClick`, `onSubmit`, `onChange` — and
JSX nested deeper than two levels. Declarative markup stays where it is, however
wordy; a file and a jump buy nothing there.

```tsx
if (needsInvoiceSetup) {    // stays — no handlers, nothing to carry away
  return (
    <List>
      <List.Item
        icon={Icon.Gear}
        title="Fill in the invoice details first"
        actions={
          <ActionPanel>
            <Action.Push title="Open Settings" target={<Settings />} />
          </ActionPanel>
        }
      />
    </List>
  );
}

if (isEditingLineItems) {   // goes — onChange and onRemove per row, three deep
  return <LineItemEditor items={items} onSave={saveLineItems} />;
}
```

What moves with the extracted component is its state and its handlers, which is
the point; the early returns above it stay a table of contents for the screen.
Loading and empty states — `return <Form isLoading />` — are the same case,
already one line.

## Reach for the runtime before a dependency

Node and Bun ship most of what a utility library used to. Check the engine the
project pins — `engines`, the Docker base image — before installing anything or
writing a formatter by hand.

| Instead of | Use |
| --- | --- |
| date-fns, moment, hand-rolled date strings | `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` |
| a currency or percent helper | `Intl.NumberFormat` |
| pluralize | `Intl.PluralRules` |
| lodash `groupBy`, `cloneDeep` | `Object.groupBy`, `structuredClone` |
| axios | `fetch` |
| p-timeout, a manual `AbortController` timer | `AbortSignal.timeout` |

`Intl` takes locale and time zone as arguments — pass them explicitly rather
than inheriting whatever the host has.

## Files are kebab-case, one entity per file

`create-vault.ts`, not `createVault.ts`. Intra-file order: imports → the primary
export → private helpers below it.
